# HardJump-Platorm-Game
A single or two-player platform game jumping game made this using the processing IDE. The goal of the game is to collect all the coins (single player) or collect all the coins faster than the other player (two player). You can change the difficulty of the game by changing the density of the platforms or increasing / decreasing the number of coins in the Platform_Game2.pde file.
